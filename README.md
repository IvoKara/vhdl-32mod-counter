# FPGA 32-modulus programmable counter

This is the source code of a course project form Technical University - Sofia that aims to create an 32-modulus (5-bit / MOD-32) counter using the Programmable Logic Devices (PLD) on a FPGA chip.

It is intended to be used on **Xilnx XC3S100** device of the **Spartan3E** family.<br/>
May be used with *TQ144* or *CP132* package.
